    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Jambalaya is a one-pot dish that's made with rice, meat or seafood, and vegetables. With French and Spanish influences, jambalaya is quite similar to paella. The name "jambalaya" likely comes from the Provençal word "jambalaia," which means mishmash.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p><ul>
        <li>Oil: Chicken and andouille sausage are sautéed in peanut oil.</li>
        <li>Sausage: Opt for andouille sausage for the most authentic jambalaya.</li>
        <li>Chicken: Cut one pound of boneless, skinless chicken breasts into 1-inch pieces.</li>
        <li>Spices and seasonings: This chicken and sausage jambalaya is flavored with Cajun seasoning, fresh garlic, red pepper flakes, salt, pepper, hot sauce, Worcestershire sauce, and file powder.</li>
        <li>Vegetables: You'll need an onion, green bell peppers, and celery.</li>
        <li>Rice: Opt for plain white rice for this jambalaya recipe.</li>
    </ul></p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
