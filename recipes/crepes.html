    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Crêpes are very thin pancakes. They can be served with a wide variety of sweet and savory fillings and toppings. The breakfast staple dates back to at least 13th-century France.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p><ul>
        <li>Flour: These basic French crêpes start with a cup of all-purpose flour.</li>
        <li>Eggs: Eggs act as a binder, which means they help hold the batter together.</li>
        <li>Milk: Milk adds moisture and keeps the crêpes tender.</li>
        <li>Water: Water helps thin the batter.</li>
        <li>Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor.</li>
        <li>Butter: Butter lends richness and moisture to the crêpes.</li>
    </ul></p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>

        <li>Gradually add the milk and water.</li>
